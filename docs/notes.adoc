== Operating Systems
=== Linux
On linux, you can only exccess the opengl drivers from the root user. This mean
you need the program to be ran like `sudo ./<name of game>`. Is there a way to
resolve this?

- posible solution https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26421803/run-my-executable-automatically-as-root-ubuntu[root:root]

[source, bash]
----
sudo chown root:root ./program
sudo chmod a+s ./program
----

== Pointers
*ALWAYS* initialize to `NULL`. use `assert()` to check if null when needed. Set back
to `NULL` after freeing data.

== Compiling
place libraries and include files in _/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/_.

== GLFW 
=== GLFW Event Processing

Partially from the https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/intro_guide.html[intro guide]

GLFW Event Porcessing is not https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2799023/what-exactly-is-a-reentrant-function[reentrant].

GLFW event processing and object destruction are not reentrant. This means that
the following functions must not be called from any callback function:

* glfwDestroyWindow
* glfwDestroyCursor
* glfwPollEvents
* glfwWaitEvents
* glfwWaitEventsTimeout
* glfwTerminate

A computer program or routine is described as reentrant if it can be safely
called again before its previous invocation has been completed (i.e it can be
safely executed concurrently). To be reentrant, a computer program or routine:

1. Must hold no static (or global) non-constant data.

2. Must not return the address to static (or global) non-constant data.

3. Must work only on the data provided to it by the caller.

4. Must not rely on locks to singleton resources.

5. Must not modify its own code (unless executing in its own unique thread
   storage)

6. Must not call non-reentrant computer programs or routines.

How is safely defined?

If a program can be safely executed concurrently, does it always mean that it is
reentrant?

What exactly is the common thread between the six points mentioned that I should
keep in mind while checking my code for reentrant capabilities?

Also,

1. Are all recursive functions reentrant?

2. Are all thread-safe functions reentrant?

3. Are all recursive and thread-safe functions reentrant?

=== Thread Saftey
The reference documentation for every GLFW function states whether it is limited
to the main thread.

Initialization, termination, event processing and the creation and destruction
of windows, cursors and OpenGL and OpenGL ES contexts are all restricted to the
main thread due to limitations of one or several platforms.

=== Frame buffer
There is also `glfwGetFramebufferSize` for directly retrieving the current size of
the framebuffer of a window.

[source, c]
----
int width, height;
glfwGetFramebufferSize(window, &width, &height);
glViewport(0, 0, width, height);
----

The size of a framebuffer may change independently of the size of a window, for
example if the window is dragged between a regular monitor and a high-DPI one.
